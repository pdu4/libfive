 *  different classes, and dispatches based on the first argument
 *  to get().
 *
 *  It owns all objects allocated under it, and allocates in blocks
 *  of N (by default 512).
 *
 *  It is not thread-safe; you should create one Pool per thread.
 *
 *  The target class must include a reset(...) function, and the
 *  constructor must take zero arguments.
